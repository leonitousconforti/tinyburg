This is a hobby project of mine that I work on in my free time for fun and to explore technologies I am interested in. Please keep that in mind. All the packages in the project are still in an alpha stage, I change apis and split packages up when and where I see fit. If that bothers you or you feel like there is a better way of doing things, feel free to fork this project and do what you want with it. Without further ado...

# Tinyburg

This project is a rush monorepo comprised of around a dozen individual packages

these packages can be found in the /packages folder:
@tinyburg/core
@tinyburg/cli
@tinyburg/architect
@tinyburg/doorman
@tinyburg/insight
@tinyburg/bots
@tinyburg/tsconfig-rig

Whereas these packages can be found in the /apps folder:
@tinyburg/authproxy
@tinyburg/backend
@tinyburg/frontend
@tinyburg/repl.it
@tinyburg/models

Nothing relevant to Tinyburg is in the /common folder, that is just a place where rush stores some data
