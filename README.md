# Tinyburg

Tinyburg is a collection of javascript projects centered around the mobile game TinyTower by Nimblebit. What started as a small idea, wanting to be automatically entered into the raffle every hour, has grown over time into this monorepo. This monorepo is separated into two different folders, the /packages folder and the /apps folder, the difference between them being that projects in the /packages folder are generally public and published to npm whereas projects in the /apps folder are not. Nothing relevant to Tinyburg is in the /common folder, that is just a place where rush (the monorepo tool) stores some data. More documentation for each project can be found on their individual readme

## Note about contributing

I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work.

Thank you for contributing!
