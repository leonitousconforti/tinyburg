# Tinyburg

Tinyburg is a collection of typescript projects centered around the mobile game TinyTower by Nimblebit. What started as a small idea, wanting to be automatically entered into the raffle every hour, has grown over time into this monorepo. This monorepo is separated into two different folders, the /packages folder and the /apps folder, the difference between them being that projects in the /packages folder are generally public and published to npm whereas projects in the /apps folder are not. Nothing relevant to Tinyburg is in the /common folder, that is just a place where rush (the monorepo tool) stores some data. More documentation for each project can be found on their individual readme's.
