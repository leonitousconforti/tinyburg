# @tinyburg/auto-gold-bits

Auto gold bits is a implementation of the DYN0 bot. If you send it a bitizen, it will max the stats and send it back to you automatically. Additionally, if you are currently requesting bitizens for a particular floor it will set the dream job to that floor. This auto gold bits implementation runs every 15 minutes, so you should get your bitizen back within that time frame.

## Friend code

Send your bitizens to `DF4NP`

## Self hosting

You need to request an api key with at least the following scopes: `social_getGifts`, `social_pullFriendMeta`, `social_sendItem`, and `social_receiveItem`.

## Coming soon

A "deploy on DigitalOcean" one-click deploy button that lets you host this yourself.
