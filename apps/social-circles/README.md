# @tinyburg/social-circles

This is an experiment to analyze the social/friend network of TinyTower. I value privacy, as such, this is an opt-in experiment. Your data will not be analyzed unless you explicitly grant permission for that to happen, see below for how to do so. You can choose to delete your data at any time. For extra peace of mind (if you are worried) you should enable "Only Friend Visits" in the settings menu (I don't think it is enabled by default) which will prevent this analysis on your data even if you fill out the permission form below. If you want to participate in the experiment but want to keep "Only Friend Visits" turned on, then you should add `DF4NP` as a friend.

## Consent and Deletion Form

Use the form below to consent to your friends list being scraped

And this one to request deletion of all data that includes you

## Datasets

I will work on making snapshots of the datasets available every couple of months, as of right now though, I have no idea even if I will have any meaningful data so I have no idea when that first snapshot would be.

In the meantime, if you have an analysis you really want to do on this data -regardless of expertise- feel free to reach out and we can work to get it integrated with the live dataset.
