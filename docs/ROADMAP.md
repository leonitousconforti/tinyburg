# Roadmap

I consider everything here to still be in a alpha stages and I have no timeline for a beta release so don't expect anything near a stable release to come anytime soon. Breaking changes and bugs will be frequent. I am working on automatic unit tests for different versions of the game - but they are incomplete. The latest version of the game that I tested was v4.1.0 so understand that modifying your save game data with a later version of the game might introduce errors. If you just want to do raffle/visits/gifts/etc actions and don't care about modifying your save game data then there is no possibility of introducing errors.

## Items I am currently working on

-   [ ] stabilizing @tinyburg/architect so it never crashes or fails to start
-   [ ] automatic ci tests using @tinyburg/architect
-   [ ] integrating @tinyburg/architect into @tinyburg/doorman
