## index.ts overview

Tiny Tower Vegas (game code `vegas`) NBSync api endpoints.

Signing: a random `salt` (signed int32) goes in the path, and `hash` is
`md5(<preimage> + <game secret salt>)` with the preimage
`vegas/<playerId>/<salt><playerAuthKey>` (variants noted per endpoint). The
secret salt is the value extracted from `NBSync._ss`.

Verification (live server + Frida DTO inspection of the game, 2026-08-26):

- Signing is MD5, server-validated (same scheme as Tiny Tower / Pocket
  Planes; the game computes SHA-256 only for the unauthenticated `register`).
- Response envelopes VERIFIED by reading the game's DTO classes at runtime:
  register, player_details, sync/pull (NBSyncGameSaveResponse), current_version,
  verify_device, friend/pull_game, friend/pull_meta (meta is a flat
  Dictionary<String,Object> on pt), send_item (NBSyncItemsSendResponse),
  get_items (NBSyncItemsGetResponse: success/gifts, NO `total` unlike pp).
  `get_items` was also exercised live with a burnbot.
- Standard NBSync endpoint set plus get_visits and receive_item.

Game-specific save/meta schemas are left as `Schema.Unknown` placeholders.
