# @tinyburg/apks

an internal package that stores all versions of TinyTower that I want tinyburg to support, ready to be consumed by other tools such as @tinyburg/architect or @tinyburg/insight. There are downloaded apks from apkpure and apkmirror and they will never be uploaded to github because they are so large. I was going to get apks from gplaydl as well but the github issues recently seem to suggest that it is broken so I did not try it.
